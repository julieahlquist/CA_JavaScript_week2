// Exercise 1

let numberArray = [ 3, 24, 72 ]

let number = numberArray[1]

123/12 is a number, "strings", variables that doesn't have an assigned value are undefined

let myArray = [ 'Thomas', 'Amber', 'Raoul' ]
let emptyArray = []
for (i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    myArray.push(people[i])
}

// Exercise 2
this is the 'owner' of the method, eqvivalent to self in ruby

class Person {
    constructor (first, last) { 
        this.first = first;        
        this.last = last;
    }

    this.setName = function (first, last){ 
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last;
    }
}

// Async/await
putting async function redirects Javascript to always return 
a Promise, which is advantage is that its 'safer'. An asynchronous
function can be paused by await, so that the promise is returned
when whatever the machine is running meanwhile, is completed, 
which is favorable since it doesn't 'cost' any resources.
